# stm32f746_ack
This example mimicked a Produce / Consuer.
Client Task requests message with ack, Produce Task (LED Task) reply with ack when message arrived.
Finally, Produce task replied with response when request is done.

You need to adust timer values accordingly.

I hope you to get idea from this project.
